ESPN and Yahoo don't have a method of ranking players based on aggregate statistics <br>
e.g. https://fantasy.espn.com/basketball/players/projections <br>
You can only sort players by a specific category which is not that helpful when you want to build a team around multiple statistics <br>
Created a Python program that lets you determine who the best fantasy players are based on multiple statistics from 2019-2020 NBA player data <br>
Let me know if I missed any important statistics, I tailored it to the league that I joined <br>
